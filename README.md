This repository is still under development  

This repository contains submodules that are not open sourced and are only available through the Chainapsisâ€™ official Keplr Extension release. However, all primary features of the extension will work without the closed sourced submodules.  

## Dev
Keplr extension repo uses git-secret to encrypt the endpoints and the api keys. So, you can't build this without creating your own config file. You should create your own `config.var.ts`, `config.ui.var.ts` files inside the `packages/extension/src` folder. Refer to the `config.var.example.ts`, ``config.ui.var.example.ts`` sample files to create your own configuration.
```sh
yarn dev
``` 
Extension's build output is placed in `packages/extension/dist`, and you can check out [this page](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) for installing the developing extension.  

You can add your chain by adding the chain information into `chain-info.ts`. 

## Example Files

Refer to the [Keplr Example repository](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-example) for examples of how to integrate Keplr signing support for your web interface/application.
