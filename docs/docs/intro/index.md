# Keplr wallet Documentation

## Introduction

Keplr is a non-custodial blockchain wallets for webpages that allow users to interact with blockchain applications.

## Why Keplr?

#### User Security and Trust
Keplr enhances user security by storing private keys locally, removing the need for websites to manage sensitive user data. This eliminates the risks associated with external key management and ensures that users only need to trust Keplr's security guarantees. With this approach, users can freely interact with web applications while independently verifying transaction details.

#### Developer Convenience
Keplr simplifies blockchain integration for developers by offering seamless compatibility with libraries like CosmJS. This eliminates complex connection processes, making it easier for developers to link web applications to blockchains and focus on creating user-centric experiences.

#### Multi-Chain Support Across Ecosystems
Keplr supports a wide range of blockchains, including Cosmos SDK-based chains, EVM-based chains, and Starknet, making it a versatile wallet for dApp developers. Additionally, Keplr is actively expanding its boundaries to support other major blockchain ecosystems, providing developers with a future-proof solution to reach broader audiences.

#### Cross-Platform Accessibility
Available as both a browser extension and mobile app, Keplr ensures users can securely access their wallets and interact with dApps on their preferred platform. This comprehensive accessibility empowers developers to build scalable and user-friendly dApps that meet modern multi-platform demands.
