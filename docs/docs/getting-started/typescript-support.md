**`window.d.ts`**
```javascript
import { Window as KeplrWindow } from "@keplr-wallet/types";

declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
  interface Window extends KeplrWindow {}
}
```

The `@keplr-wallet/types` package has the type definition related to Keplr.  
If you're using TypeScript, run `npm install --save-dev @keplr-wallet/types` or `yarn add -D @keplr-wallet/types` to install `@keplr-wallet/types`.  
Then, you can add the `@keplr-wallet/types` window to a global window object and register the Keplr related types.
