# Connect to Keplr

Integrating your dApp with Keplr allows you to provide seamless interactions for your users. To meet various development needs, Keplr offers flexible integration methods, as detailed below:

- [Direct Integration](#direct-integration)
- [Keplr Wallet SDK](#keplr-wallet-sdk)

---

## Direct Integration

The most straightforward approach to connect your dApp to Keplr is by utilizing the provider that Keplr injects directly into your web application. This provider is globally available at `window.keplr`. With this integration, you'll always have access to the latest functionality provided by Keplr.

### How to Detect Keplr

To check if Keplr is installed on a user's device, you can verify the presence of `window.keplr`. If `window.keplr` is `undefined` after the `document.load` event, Keplr is not installed. Below are some examples of how to wait for the load event to check the status.

Register a function to `window.onload`:

```javascript
window.onload = async () => {
  if (!window.keplr) {
    alert("Please install the Keplr extension.");
  } else {
    const chainId = "cosmoshub-4";

    // It is recommended to enable Keplr before using it.
    // This method prompts the user to allow access if they haven't visited this website before.
    // Additionally, it requests the user to unlock the wallet if it is locked.
    await window.keplr.enable(chainId);

    const offlineSigner = window.keplr.getOfflineSigner(chainId);

    // Retrieve the address and public keys using the `getAccounts` method.
    // This method returns an array of address/public key pairs.
    // Note: Currently, the Keplr extension manages only a single address/public key pair.
    // XXX: This step is required to set the sender address for SigningCosmosClient.
    const accounts = await offlineSigner.getAccounts();

    // Initialize the Gaia API with the offline signer provided by the Keplr extension.
    const cosmJS = new SigningCosmosClient(
      "https://lcd-cosmoshub.keplr.app",
      accounts[0].address,
      offlineSigner
    );
  }
};
```

Or track the document's ready state through the document event listener:

```javascript
async getKeplr(): Promise<Keplr | undefined> {
    if (window.keplr) {
        return window.keplr;
    }

    if (document.readyState === "complete") {
        return window.keplr;
    }

    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const documentStateChange = (event: Event) => {
            if (
                event.target &&
                (event.target as Document).readyState === "complete"
            ) {
                resolve(window.keplr);
                document.removeEventListener("readystatechange", documentStateChange);
            }
        };

        document.addEventListener("readystatechange", documentStateChange);
    });
}
```

## Keplr Wallet SDK

For a more modular approach, you can use the Keplr client by using the JavaScript SDK. This allows you to connect your dApp to Keplr by installing the SDK via package managers. The client provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with Keplr, making integration simpler and more scalable for complex projects.

#### Installation Steps

1. Install `@keplr-wallet/provider-extension` via package managers.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
       ```bash npm i @keplr-wallet/provider-extension ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
       ```bash yarn add @keplr-wallet/provider-extension ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Import the SDK into your application.

   ```tsx
   import { Keplr } from "@keplr-wallet/provider-extension";
   ```

3. Initialize the SDK.

   ```tsx
   export const getKeplrFromProvider = async () => {
     return await Keplr.getKeplr();
   };
   ```
